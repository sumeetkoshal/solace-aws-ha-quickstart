# Install and configure Solace message routers in an HA tuple using AWS Cloud Formation

![alt text](https://github.com/sumeetkoshal/solace-aws-ha-quickstart/tree/master/images/Solace-AWS-HA-3AZ.png "Production enviroment for Solace VMR")

This QuickStart template installs Solace Virtual Message Routers (VMRs) in high-availability (HA) redundancy groups for fault tolerance. HA redundancy provides 1:1 router sparing to increase overall service availability. If one of the routers fails or is taken out of service, the other router automatically takes over and provides service to the clients that were previously served by the now-out-of-service router.  To increase availability the meassage routers are deployed across 3 availability zones.

To learn more about VMR redundancy see the [Redundancy Documentation](http://docs.solace.com/Features/VMR-Redundancy.htm).  If you are not familiar with Solace or the high-available configurations it is recommended that you review this document.

Alternatively this quickstart can create Solace VMRs in an enviroment suitable for Proof Of Concept testing where loss of an AWS Availability Zone will not cause loss of access to mission critical data.

To learn more about connectivity to the HA redundancy group see the AWS [VPC Gateway Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html).

# How to Deploy a VMR HA 
This is a two step process:

* Go to the Solace Developer portal and request a Solace Evaluation edition VMR. This process will return an email with a Download link. Do a right click "Copy Hyperlink" on the "Download the VMR Evaluation Edition for Docker" hyperlink.  This will be needed in the following section.

</a>

* Go to AWS Cloud Formation service and launch template.  The following links are for your convenience and take you directly to the templates for Solace Mesage Routers.

</a>

* If you want to take a look under the covers, you can view the AWS CloudFormation template that automates the deployment. You can customize the template during launch, or download and extend it for other projects.

# Filling the templates
Select the Launch Quick Start (for new VPC) above will take you to the AWS "Select Template" tab with the Solace template references, hit the next button in the bottom right corner.

The next screen will allow you to fill in the details of the root AWS stack for this solution:

# About Quick Starts

Quick Starts are automated reference deployments for key workloads on the AWS Cloud. Each Quick Start launches, configures, and runs the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS, using AWS best practices for security and availability.

# Testing data access to the ha cluster

To test data traffic though the newly created VMR instances, visit the Solace developer portal and and select your prefered programming langauge to [send and receive messages](http://dev.solace.com/get-started/send-receive-messages/). Under each language there is a Publish/Subscribe tutorial that will help you get started.
